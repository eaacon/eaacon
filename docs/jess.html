                        I've been meaning to get more familiar with character creation beyond the modest target of my indie game assets. The freedom to make quick sketches in 3D as well as familiarizing myself with ways to push beyond are both things I want to pursue.                        
                    </p>
                    <p>Sculpted and textured in <b>3D Coat</b>, modelled acessories and rendered in <b>Blender EEVEE</b>.</p>

                    <p>
                        I made this turnaround to provide a stylized target reference for my model.
                    </p>
                    <p>Clothes, acessories, and stylized anatomy allow me to play with a reasonable range of materials and challenges during the process.</p>
