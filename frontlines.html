                Hello! 
                <br>
                <br> 
                First off, thanks to anyone who may be reading this haphazard and rushed blog thing of mine. I really wanted to present some of my process and thoughts so I'll do what I can until 11/3.
                <br>
                <br>
                What you're seeing now are various thumbnails done both digitally and with charcoal I had made at the very start. I had around a month and a half to prepare for this, and the two fundamental ideas that I started out with were the medieval theme and it being big.
            </p>

                The fantasy novels I head read were really the catalyst of my love for creating. Whether its art or stories or worlds or anything, as a child, I felt like there was so much freedom in exploring just the coolness of everything.
                <br><br>
                As I got older, games and film were introduced to me, and I found a deeper level of "realness" and physicality to the mystery that was fantasy. Oftentimes fantastical concepts can feel like they came out of nowhere, but over time what was made very apparent to me were the countless influences.
                <br><br>
                When tackling more ambitious projects, its often difficult to know where to start or how to grapple with all of the different elements that you want to include or that suprise you. What I have found provides me the most motivating, stable, and rewarding result is really researching and developing those elements so that they can serve you.
            </p>

                You may expect the worlds of Tolkien's Lord of the Rings or the Avatar film to be deep and well thought out, but the more you look into them it's even more ridiculous than you couldve imagined. The depth in cultural traditions, language, biology, society, and every other aspect of those worlds is unbeliveable and largely invisible in much of what is seen in front of us.
                <br>
                <br>
                And although I don't think all IP's need the same levels of depth, as it largely depends on what it actually is and the intent, I think a serious effort to take time and think about your work is incredibly valuable. In my case, I don't have the time or expertise to do anything on the level of what was perviously mentioend. However, I set aside nearly half of my time (while prepping my materials) to do research and think.

                Visits to the museum and talks with my teachers about Pre-Raphaelite, Symbolist, and History Paintings were really insightful, along with looking at film stills with compositional and observational characteristics I enjoy were the intital feeling phase. Bur for the actual subject matter, I was originally thinking of recontextualizing the common video game trope of the damsel in distress (I had been thinking about mario). And how oftentimes the purpose of a princess being captured is just to be a catalyst for the strong male hero to save them. I had wanted to present the situation in a less comedic way, but also provide strength to the victim, rather than to a hero.
                <br>

                That was what most of my intial thumbs were, but it quickly became difficult to convey the message In the way I wanted. This was when the period of history when the Grand Duchy of Lithuania was invaded by the crusading Teutonic Knights. That at least provided opposing sides (conflict), a setting, time period, armour styling and many other elements that I felt I could work with. And since I had come across this in the first computer game I ever played with my dad, Age of Empires, I felt a slight personal connection as well.
                <br>
                <br>
                After some other failed ideas and exploring the possibility of female knighthood, I looked around for manuscripts, papers, or other research that might lead me to a protagonist. I then came across the prescence of women in old swordsmanship training materials around that time. As well as the general sentiment that there were actually a few women who did take up arms, (Most notably Joan of Arc but I was more interested in the unnamed ones). With all of that, eventually the subject became this:
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                An unnamed woman takes initiative and takes a stand against invading knights. On the front lines, she risks her life alongside her country, a hero just like the ones exclusively highlighted in history.
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                It provided me a somewhat standard but solidly informed scenario for me to paint something I'm now conceptually and visually interested in. What really appealed to me was that this character (and the women shown in the historical documents) aren't some god from above that has superpowers, but rather simply a citizen with the means to fight just like everybody else in the war. And thats pretty heroic too.

            This is about all I have time to write, so the rest will be images throughout the making of the physical painting. I'll definitely come back to update this and talk about the physical painting process as well as some context on 14th century Lithuania (and Poland)(I have several pages of notes). All of this was primarily to help me construct the image in the first place, and even this writing is mostly for me, since even if no one reads this I feel like it makes the experience as a whole feel more real and rewarding. I'm not even sure I like the painting as I was so caught up in it, stepping back reveals alot of greviences. Despite all that, I think I'm happy with what I was able to do in the time. Thanks to anyone who came to see it!
