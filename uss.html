                    <p>This was my submission to the Atomhawk Art Competition!</p>
                    <p>The theme was Under Strange Suns and I was incredibly excited to tackle a sci-fi concept. Its a bit out of my comfort zone but I'm happy with what I came up with, especially with the time I had.</p>
                    <p>Two ideas came to mind at the start. Either a "strange" alien planet, with crazy life forms and Moebius-esque landscapes, or "strange" as in not as it should be, with the sun being replaced by an alien carrier ship, Death Star style. I really wanted to try my hand at modelling some ships, And I thought I could play around with some atmosphere, so I went with the latter.</p>
                    <p>I also used this as an opportunity to practice the workflow of bringing in 3D renders and photobashing.</p>
                    <p>Software used were primarily Blender and Photoshop.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <p>This is what I was most excited about. As I had around a week, I decided to spend a full day ideating the main spaceship design. I wanted to lean towards "astronaut" rather than futuristic, so I referenced fighter jets and modern space rockets rather than abstract or organic aircraft. Since we're seeing the backside only, I decided a single booster would be the best way to go. </p>
                    <p>I initially had actual landing gear, but after seeing Destiny's ships float down, I decided this simpler approach would be cleaner.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <p>I wanted to differentiate from the our protagonist's ship with sharp angular lines and spikes, as well as use sun/lens flare motifs to emphasize the role the ship carrier was taking. I kept the models simple, but made sure the silhouette and lights were clearly placed.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <p>After several attempts moving around the ship, carrier, and adjusting the ground, I settled with this composition. It's fairly standard but provides a great view of both the ship and the star carrier as a sun proxy. I decided to still include an actual sun behind, so that the comparison between the real and the alien was clear. It also led to a purple-orange color scheme which I felt fit the tone I wanted.</p>
                    <p>I then progressively tweaked and added more assets, most were made by me but some foliage were supplemented with megascans.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <p>This was the final render before my paint over, It set up the atmospheric perspective well, and gave me a base I was happy to paint over. My PC doesn't have a graphics card, so although the iteration was quite slow, I was satisfied with the result.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <p>With two days left, I did the final paint over. The main considerations were color, shapes, and texture. Photobashing helped accelerate the various materials, and I cleaned up/fully replaced many of the silhouettes. I redid the entire sky, and did a detail pass over everything.</p>
                    <p>To the left are the clay render, and also the hidden lizard I added in the bottom right corner for the final image.</p>
