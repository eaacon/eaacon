                    <p>Hello!</p>
                    <p>This was my character concept submission to Sinix's Chroma Corps Competition!</p>
                    <p>I knew I wanted to design a character with an animal companion, and I was inspired at the time by african beads, body paint,and other traditions often symbolizing a passage into adulthood or used in festivals</p>
                    <p>The Krobo people in Ghana and their Dipo festival were looked at in particular; however, instead of a trial to womanhood with a focus on virginity or marriage, Akua's world uses their festival as a test to send worthy individuals on a journey of exploration</p>
                    <p>The Dromceros is a beast of labor traditionally provided by Akua's tribe to those who pass the test, and are a living representation of the tenacity valued by her people and needed on her journey. Their iconic white legs are reflected by the body paint on Akua's legs, indicating their bond.</p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <p>This is the turnaround for the character, and I took specifc care to look at beads and cloth from the Krobo people, but also blending in elements from other cultures like the Hamer from Ethiopia who also make use of beads.</p>
                    <p>For her weapon, thought about a tool that could be multi-purpose. As a grounded and mounted weapon, a blunt tool for knocking down fruit and prodding through obstacles, and a hook for pulling difficult-to-reach objects towards her. It sits nicely between the Dromero's large horns and is suprisingly light for its size.</p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <p>You can see the various references I used for the character, as well as the flower which is both kept by Akua and also carved into her weapon are naitive to her village. I decided to keep the cloth a bit more subdued compared to the Krobo people's, since it began to become crowded visually since I incorporated some higher frequency sets of beads.</p>
